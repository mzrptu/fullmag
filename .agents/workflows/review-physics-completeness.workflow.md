# Workflow: review-physics-completeness

## Purpose

Review whether a physics-facing feature is complete enough to merge.

## Review protocol

1. Does the corresponding `docs/physics/` note exist?
2. Are equations, symbols, SI units, and assumptions complete?
3. Are Python API, `ProblemIR`, planner, and capability updates aligned?
4. Are FDM, FEM, and hybrid differences explicit?
5. Are validation status, observables, and deferred work recorded?

## Verdict

- `GO` — ready to merge
- `BLOCK` — documentation or validation is incomplete
