# Fullmag agents guide

> **This file is the single source of truth for all AI models working on Fullmag**

> All other instruction files (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`,
> `.github/instructions/*.md`) must reference this file and must not contradict it.

## North star

Fullmag describes a physical micromagnetic problem, not a numerical storage layout.
Every change must preserve that contract across Python API, `ProblemIR`, planning, and backend execution.

## Current execution priority

The current top execution priority is a calibrated GPU-first FDM/CUDA path.

That means:

1. CPU exchange-only FDM remains the trusted `double` reference.
2. CUDA FDM lands before FEM execution work resumes.
3. User-selected execution precision (`single` / `double`) must be explicit in Python API, `ProblemIR`, planning, and provenance.
4. GPU `double` parity is required before GPU `single` becomes public-executable.

## Canonical instruction sources

- **`AGENTS.md` (this file)** is the canonical source of all project rules.
- `docs/specs/fullmag-application-architecture-v2.md` is the canonical application architecture document.
- `docs/specs/session-run-api-v1.md` is the canonical session/run runtime contract.
- `.agents/` contains agent workflows and skills that extend these rules.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/` mirror a summary for Copilot.
- `docs/physics/TEMPLATE.md` is the only canonical template for publication-style physics notes.

## Golden rule: physics before implementation

This rule is non-negotiable.

Before implementing any physics or numerical feature, create or update a publication-style note in `docs/physics/` covering:

1. problem statement and physical motivation,
2. governing equations, symbols, SI units, and assumptions,
3. FDM, FEM, and hybrid interpretation,
4. Python API and `ProblemIR` impact,
5. planner and capability-matrix impact,
6. validation strategy and observables,
7. completeness checklist across the stack,
8. known limits and deferred work.

If the note does not exist or is incomplete, the task is not ready for implementation.

## Architectural guardrails

1. The only public scripting surface is the embedded Python DSL in `packages/fullmag-py`.
2. Python scripts build object graphs and canonical `ProblemIR`; Rust validates, normalizes, and plans that IR.
3. The shared API must never expose grid indices, GPU array internals, or FEM-only implementation details.
4. `strict`, `extended`, and `hybrid` are first-class execution semantics from day one.
5. Rust remains the control plane: validation, normalization, planning, runner, API, provenance.
6. Native compute stays behind stable C ABI boundaries.
7. Containerized workflows are the default verification path.
8. `docs/physics/` notes are auto-rendered into frontend documentation — writing physics docs is writing user docs.
9. **No single source file should exceed ~1000 lines.** When a module grows past this threshold, split it into focused submodules. Monolithic files are harder to review, test, and maintain. Prefer many small, well-named files over few large ones.

## Canonical build and run entrypoints

- Prefer `justfile` recipes over ad-hoc `cargo`, `make`, and raw `docker compose` commands whenever a matching recipe exists.
- Treat these as the canonical build entrypoints:
  - `just build fullmag` — build/install the local launcher on the host
  - `just build fem-gpu-runtime-host` — build the heavy FEM GPU runtime in the managed container and export a host-usable runtime bundle
  - `just package fullmag` — assemble the host-side staging package
- Treat these as the canonical run entrypoints when applicable:
  - `just run ...`
  - `just run-py-layer-hole`
  - `just control-room`
- `make` remains a compatibility/developer fallback. Use it only when no `just` recipe exists yet or when explicitly debugging lower-level build stages.
- Raw `docker compose` and raw `cargo` build commands are acceptable for debugging, narrow reproduction, or adding new recipes, but they should not be the default workflow recommended back to the user.

- `crates/fullmag-engine` — reference CPU solver (exchange-only LLG + Heun).
- `crates/fullmag-cli` — CLI for IR validation, planning, and execution.
- `crates/fullmag-api` — control-plane HTTP API.

- `external_solvers/` — **reference solver codebases** (not part of Fullmag, gitignored).

## Reference solvers

`external_solvers/` contains full source trees of existing micromagnetic solvers. These are **read-only references** — study them for patterns and best practices, never copy code verbatim.

| Directory | Solver | Language | Method | Learn from |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| `external_solvers/3/` | **mumax3** | Go + CUDA | FDM | Lightweight workflow, CUDA kernel patterns, cuFFT demag, batch/server mode, `engine/` module structure |
| `external_solvers/plus/` | **mumax+** | C++/CUDA + Python | FDM | **Python API design** (`mumaxplus/` package), extensible core, C++/CUDA kernel architecture, `src/` operator layout |
| `external_solvers/BORIS/` | **BORIS** | C++/CUDA | FDM | Multiphysics design, multi-GPU path, spin transport, `Boris/` module organization, CUDA library patterns |
| `external_solvers/tetmag/` | **tetmag** | C++ | FEM | FEM mesh pipeline, GPU operator assembly, tetrahedral discretization, `gpu/` kernels, boundary conditions |
| `external_solvers/tetrax/` | **tetrax** | Python | FEM | Python-first FEM workflow, `tetrax/` package structure, test patterns, pyproject packaging |

### When to consult reference solvers

- **Designing a new CUDA kernel** → check `3/cuda/`, `plus/src/`, `BORIS/BorisCUDALib/`
- **Designing Python API classes** → check `plus/mumaxplus/` (closest to our architecture)
- **Implementing energy terms** → compare operator structures across all solvers
- **FEM discretization** → check `tetmag/` and `tetrax/tetrax/`
- **Demag/FFT pipeline** → check `3/engine/` and `plus/src/`
- **Time integrators** → compare approaches in `3/engine/`, `plus/src/`, `BORIS/Boris/`
- **Writing validation tests** → check `3/test/`, `plus/test/`, `tetmag/examples/`, `tetrax/tests/`

## Definition of done for foundation changes

- The change strengthens the embedded Python DSL or typed IR boundary.
- Physics-facing changes include a corresponding `docs/physics/` update.
- README, AGENTS, skills, prompts, and web/CLI copy stay aligned.
- Containerized checks cover Rust, Python, repo consistency, and smoke flow.
- No source file exceeds ~1000 lines; large modules are split into focused submodules.
