# Mesh and region discretization

- Status: draft
- Last updated: 2026-03-23

## 1. Problem statement

Geometry imports, region tagging, and material assignment are the first point where backend-neutral physics semantics meet backend-specific numerical representation.
This layer must remain neutral in the shared Python API while still supporting voxelization, meshing, and mesh-grid projection later in the pipeline.

## 2. Physical model

Geometry and regions define the spatial domain on which fields, materials, and energies are meaningful.
They are not energy terms by themselves, but errors here invalidate material assignment, interface semantics, and backend comparisons.

## 3. Numerical interpretation

### 3.1 FDM

Imported geometry is voxelized onto a regular grid, and regions become masks over cells.

### 3.2 FEM

Imported geometry is meshed, and regions become domain markers over elements or mesh attributes.

### 3.3 Hybrid

Hybrid execution needs explicit projection semantics between FEM mesh representation and auxiliary Cartesian grids used by selected operators.

## 4. API, IR, and planner impact

- The Python API must keep `ImportedGeometry`, `Region`, `Material`, and `Ferromagnet` distinct.
- `ProblemIR` stores geometry references and named region bindings without forcing a grid or element layout.
- The planner owns voxelization, meshing, and projection decisions.

## 5. Validation strategy

- analytical geometry sanity checks,
- region-volume consistency checks,
- geometry-import fidelity checks,
- cross-backend region assignment comparisons.

## 6. Completeness checklist

- [x] Python API
- [x] ProblemIR
- [x] Planner-facing structure
- [x] Capability matrix
- [ ] FDM backend
- [ ] FEM backend
- [ ] Hybrid backend
- [ ] Outputs / observables
- [ ] Tests / benchmarks
- [x] Documentation

## 7. Known limits and deferred work

- No production geometry import or mesh repair pipeline exists yet.
- Curved-geometry fidelity and tolerance policy are still deferred.
- This note documents semantic intent only; numerical implementation remains future work.
