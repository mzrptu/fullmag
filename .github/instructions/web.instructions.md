# Web instructions

- The web app edits or visualizes `ProblemIR`; it does not define solver semantics.
- Prefer server components and simple data flow for early scaffolding.
- Use UI language that matches the domain: problem, backend, job, artifact, comparison.
- Keep room for Monaco editor, artifact viewer, and FDM/FEM comparison workflows.
