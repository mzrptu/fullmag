description: "Use when editing Rust files in Fullmag. Keep Rust as the typed control plane with explicit domain models, planner seams, and stable interfaces."

# Rust instructions

- Prefer domain types over free-form maps and raw JSON.
- Keep crate dependencies lean; extract shared types into `fullmag-ir` before duplicating.
- Make invalid states hard to represent.
- Favor `Result`-based APIs with helpful error messages over panics.
- Keep public interfaces ready for CLI, API, and worker reuse.
- **Keep `.rs` files under ~1000 lines.** Split large modules into submodules with `mod` re-exports. A crate with one monolithic `lib.rs` is a code smell.
